# Favorita-store-sales-Forecasting
## Source
This a project of time series forecasting using data from Kaggle. https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/store-sales-time-series-forecasting/ \
## What's going on?
### Forecasting
Right now I'm stuck because i was thinking about using Porphet but I came across a lot of different data (there are 50+ stores times 20+ products), and I'm in a search for a different and more efficient approach.
### Progress
In the notebooks there are some insights and a treatment of missing data, as well as a dive in the description of the dataset itself. \
My work didn't went too far and the idea of merging (joining) all tables in a single one doesn't look too tempting. But may be a good idea to make another csv containing all the tables properly treated and joined.\
I would like to deal with the holidays associating the locality and seeing the seasonality being explained (like in all the new years the sales just drop, probably due to celebrations and the stores not opening).
